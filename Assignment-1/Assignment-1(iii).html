    <p><b>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a flat-panel display technology used in devices like TVs, monitors,
            smartphones, and tablets</b>. <i>It consists of two layers of polarized glass with a liquid crystal solution
            between them</i>. Electric currents control the alignment of liquid crystals, producing images and text on
        the screen.</p>
